This project was constructed with the purpose of displaying a basic computer interaction through a game. It evolved into an opportunity to practice leveling, landscape sculpting, inventory systems, world building and much more you can find in the game.

Fallen Civilization is a project built in Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints, with no intent of being sold or making profit. It uses free assets for personal use, that can't be included in this public repository due to terms and service.
